    "Hipmunk's first ever mobile website, featuring app-like functionality. It included smooth animations, location awareness, and an exceptional datepicker.",
    "The project started as an effort to make the desktop website more responsive, but quickly turned into a full-fledged app of its own. From start to finish, the project took roughly four months to complete.",
    "A custom framework was built for specifically for the website. The framework featured an application state controller, a view stack, a view animator, and a url handler.",
    "From a product standpoint, the mobile website improved mobile searches significantly. Now, searches on the mobile website rival both the Hipmunk Android and iOS apps. The mobile website also served as an important testbed for new product features, allowing for quick changes to be made before further effort was invested across platforms.",
